sort the sells and buys in separate tables; older to newer
then, for every sale
1.find quantity available for sale from the last year (Ql)
2.find taxable qty Qt = Qs-Ql; if this is negative, then ignorei, no tax for sale. move to next sale
3.if Qt is positive, find out the purchase price of Qt, sale price of Qt and find out tax component of sale
4. add up all individual tax components to get total tax for the year


algorithm to find qty available for sale from last year
1. find total buys till beginning of last year, Bt
2. find total sales till date,St
3. available qty = Bt-St (negatives shall be treated as zero)

algorithm to find the purchase price of Qt
1. calculate the cumulative sales (S) till date (including the one being considered)
2. parse the total buy transactions and find the transaction (Ti) at which the cumulative buy qty (B)  >= S
3. Qt1 = Ti - (B - S)
4. if Qt1 == Qt, then purchase price for Qt is same as that of Ti
    else,
    while Qt >0,
            if Ti <= Qt
                    purchase price of Qt1 is that of Ti
                    Qt = Qt - Qt1
                    i = i -1
                    Qt1 = Ti
            else if Ti > Qt
                    Qt1 = Qt
                    purchase price of Qt1 is same as that of Ti
                    break from the loop(stop calculating)

alternate method to find out capital gains:

for every sale, find out the corresponding purchase and purchase date. If the purchase date and sale date are less than one year apart, it qualifies for short term

0. extarct date pertaining to each stock, and for each stock perform the following operations
1. seggregate sells and buys
2. loop through each sale, starting from the first
    
    look at teh first buy Bi
